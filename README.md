Not Your Ordinary Shell (pronounced New York Shell for short). See http://nyosh.campagnelab.org

## Building

 1. Open the project in MPS
 1. Define the Path Variable org.campagnelab.goby.workbench.home to point to the directory where you cloned the git repository
 1. Define the Path Variable org.campagnelab.xchart.home to point to the directory where you cloned the XChart git repository (some GobyWeb languages require this project).
 1. Rebuild the project. Note that some solutions may not build and should be ignored (they are used for designing the languages but are not used in production).
